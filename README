This is a compilation of creative coding projects. 
For my other repositories that have similar data strucutures, I focused on the knowledge I retained and how to improve it based on my real work experience with data.
The repository attributes to over 5 years practicing. Recently transferred the work I saved in Visual Studio, Jypter Notebook and Colaboratory to my Github.
