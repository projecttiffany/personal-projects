This is a compilation of guided self-learning projects. The focus was gaining basic knowledge and to practice the same code repetitively. 
For my other repositories that have similar data strucutures, I focused on the knowledge I retained and how to improve it based on my real work experience with data.
The repository attributes to over 5 years of self-learning. Recently transferred the work I saved in Visual Studio and Jypter Notebook to my Github.
